## 📖 Sample Q&A (with Emoji ✨)

### 1️⃣ What is a parameter?
A **parameter** is a model's internal variable learned during training (e.g., weights in linear regression). 🧠

---

### 3️⃣ What does negative correlation mean?
📉 It means that **when one variable increases, the other decreases**.  
*Example:* As exercise ⬆️, body fat ⬇️

---

### 🔟 What is a test set?
A **test set** is used to evaluate the trained model on unseen data. 🧪

---

### 2️⃣5️⃣ What is data encoding?
Data encoding 🎯 transforms **categorical features** into **numerical format** so models can understand them.  
Popular methods:
- `LabelEncoder` 🔢
- `OneHotEncoder` 🧊
- `get_dummies()` 📊
